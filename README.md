# MIPS-programs

A collection of programs written in MIPS Assembly. Each folder inludes the source code for the program and a description of
the methods used to write the program. To run these programs, an assember is required. I used MARS 4.5 but any MIPS assembler should
work.

## Programs

1. Decimal <--> ASCII Converter
